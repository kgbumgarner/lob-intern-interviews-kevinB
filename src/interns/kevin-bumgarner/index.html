            <p style="color:white; font-size: medium;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’m from San Antonio, Texas, and I’m currently a junior at Auburn University majoring in software engineering. The main thing I want to learn during an internship (or find rather) is my niche in this ever-changing and expanding field of work. I’ve recently been trying to focus on what I like doing the most with software. For example, do I enjoy working on backend tasks or frontend tasks more or everything in between? Hopefully, that’s a question I will answer for myself with an internship. Aside from this, there are more obvious things I want to learn like how to be a better software engineer, good practices, and how to communicate better with team members who aren’t on the technical side but still involved with software projects. I didn’t know much about Software Engineering until I came to college. I realized, at that time, software engineers are making anything and everything I see on my computer or phone. I thought that was amazing! I soon started my path to becoming a software engineer thinking about that. Technology is a powerful thing and I wanted to be at the forefront of it. The kinds of software I’d like to create are still mostly unknown to me as there are many different things I can do with software engineering. I’m still trying to find my ‘niche’ as I said above. However, I am interested in creating things that are user-friendly and visibly pleasing, and things that help people obtain knowledge or grow in some aspect of their life (like their business for example).
